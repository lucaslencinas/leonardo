# Bugs or improvements

All reported bugs have been fixed! ✅

## Fixed Bugs:

1. ✅ **Total predictions vs participants** - Removed duplicate "Total Predictions" stat, kept only "Participants"
2. ✅ **Better home page** - Added explanation of the game, live participant count, and call-to-action
3. ✅ **Disable step navigation clicks** - Users must enter name/email before navigating
4. ✅ **Unnecessary navigation buttons** - "Previous" hidden on first step, buttons only show when relevant
5. ✅ **Name field placeholder** - Changed to "e.g., John Smith" to clarify full name needed
6. ✅ **Color picker mobile layout** - Changed from 5 columns to responsive 3/4/5 columns (mobile/tablet/desktop)
7. ✅ **Review stage compact layout** - Grouped predictions into sections (Personal Info, Birth Details, Physical Details)
8. ✅ **View All Results button** - Added to admin dashboard with 3-column layout

9. ✅ **Missing translations** - Added ~50 new translation keys for all newly added features (edit mode, admin dashboard, QR code, clear data modal, prediction gate) in English, Swedish, and Spanish
