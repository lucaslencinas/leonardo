# Leonardo

## Context

Me and my partner are expecting a baby boy Leo in February. I want to create a webapp that will let our family members (siblings parents uncle's ) write down their estimations on a few things from the baby: weight, height, color of eyes, color of hair, day of birth, time of birth and so n. And we will do a small present to the winner.

## Request

You are Senior Fullstack Engineer with focus on high quality webapps with tons of experience in animations and pixel perfect designs. Give me 3 options given my requirements and create a plan (if any option accepted by me) of how to do this.
Tell me which things should I be doing on my own and which things you can help me with.

## Requirements

### Tech Stack

In easy terms, I want an easy webapp using typescript. If needed, a MongoDB for storage or similar. If you choose a hosting that already has its own db service, use that one.

### Design

It has to be Playful, with a baby theme perhaps, mobile friendly, good for images, emojis, responsive and a few animations.
I want the form to be as interactible as possible, with sliders of colours for the color of hair and eye. with another sliders or positioning their estimations in a line for the height and weight and things like that.

### Hosting / Budget / Domain

I'd like to not spend any money in db, infra, hosting, domains.
